Overview
The Online Food Ordering System is a Database Management System project that efficiently manages restaurants, customers, menu items, and orders. It demonstrates database design, normalization, and implementation using SQL in a real-world scenario.

Aim
To design and implement a relational database for an online food ordering platform that ensures data accuracy, integrity, and quick information retrieval.

Objectives
Identify and design entities and relationships.

Normalize the database up to Third Normal Form (3NF).

Perform DDL and DML operations.

Retrieve data using queries and joins.

Apply constraints to maintain data consistency.

Tools & Technologies
Database: MySQL / Oracle / PostgreSQL

Frontend (optional): HTML, PHP / Flask

Platform: MySQL Workbench / XAMPP / phpMyAdmin

Documentation: MS Word / Google Docs

System Requirements
Hardware: Intel i3 or higher, minimum 4GB RAM, 10GB free space
Software: Windows or Linux, MySQL or XAMPP, MySQL Workbench

Database Design
Entities: Restaurant, Menu_Item, Customer, Orders, Order_Details

Relationships:
One restaurant offers many menu items

One customer can place many orders

Each order contains multiple menu items

Data is stored in relational tables using primary and foreign keys to maintain integrity.

Project Phases
Problem Identification: Define entities, attributes, and relationships.

Database Design: Create an E–R diagram and relational schema.

Implementation: Create tables, insert data, and establish relationships.

Execution: Perform data retrieval using SQL queries and reports.

Algorithm
Start the system and connect to the database.

Create and define all necessary tables.

Insert and manage restaurant, menu, customer, and order data.

Retrieve order summaries and reports using queries.

End the program.

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how a real-world relational database can be designed and implemented using SQL. It provides hands-on experience in database normalization, query processing, and data management, ensuring efficiency and reliability in online food ordering.

Designed and normalized a database up to 3NF.

Applied SQL operations for data manipulation and management.

Used joins, views, and constraints effectively.

Enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills in DBMS.
